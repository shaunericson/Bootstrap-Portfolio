                    With over 18 years of Systems, Asset and Service Management experience, Shaun’s passionate pursuit of technical brilliance in the System Center space led to the creation of <a href="http://www.cireson.com" target="_blank">Cireson</a> and the first-ever System Center app store, which now serves as a SCSM platform necessity for thoasands of clients across the globe. His vision to create a new standard for best-in-breed solutions shaped Cireson into the worldwide powerhouse that it is today.

Prior to launching Cireson, Shaun steeped himself in the technology industry, working with well-known companies including Peregrine, Remedy, Altiris, LANDesk and Axios. Since that time, he has dedicated himself to all things System Center.

                    Today, he enjoys contributing to community knowledge, writing blogs, and presenting at events. He especially enjoys exploring new enhancements, and making the seemingly impossible, possible.

Shaun loves to spend time with his family and indulge in great food and wine pairings. He also enjoys owning scrubs on the basketball court – and traveling in basketball attire to show his support.

Shaun’s next project: Doing his best to get to “0” emails a day in his inbox, which is a daunting task when receiving 200+ emails a day! Don’t get mad if he doesn’t respond within 24 hours, he’s trying – really.
